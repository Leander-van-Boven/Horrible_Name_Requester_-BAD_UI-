# Horrible_Name_Requester_-BAD_UI-
This is one of the worst ways to request someones name... [Is being worked on when I have spare time, so this is the first and last commit]

## How it works
### Typing the name
First our victim has to input his or her name. Sadly for the victim this is only possible using the on-screen keyboard.
This on-screen keyboard has some nice features:
* There is always one key missing.
* All keys are shuffled after each keypress.
* The backspace and enter key are shuffled with a chance of 1/8. This is to prevent rapid backspace pressing to remove typos.
* No special characters are present. People with those in their name need to ask their parents what they were thinking /s.

### Submitting the name
Submitting the typed name is pretty easy. You just press the enter button!
Then you only need to confirm that you are sure this is the right name.
This is done via the Dialogbox which also is a very handy tool:
* Everytime a new box is openened there is a 50% chance the 'Yes' and 'No' button are switched.
* If 'Yes' is pressed there is an increasing (however never a full 100%) chance that all open Dialogboxes are closed and the name is submitted.
To prevent the victim from submitting his or her name to fast the torturer can set the minimum amount of Dialogboxes that need to be accepted.
* When 'No' is pressed one time, all boxes will close and the victim needs to pass this 'test' again.

### Captcha [WIP]
To make sure the victim is a human there is a captcha which honestly can only be passed by a computer since the victim will need a calculator for this
Development is currently stalled at this item, however I have planned out how this is going to work:
1. One of the binary math operators is choosen.
2. Then two very large numbers are randomly generated.
3. These numbers are put in a label with the binary math operator between them, causing the text of this label to be longer than the width of the box it is in.
4. There however is a tooltip the victim can use to read the full formula.
5. Once the victim has calculated this formula, he or she needs to use a slider to input the result, there will be only a tooltip to know the current value of the slider.
6. If the value is correct, the name is submitted.
6.1 If the value is incorrect, everything is wiped (so the inputted name too) and the victim has to do everything all over.

# Enjoy it!
